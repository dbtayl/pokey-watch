This code should build with GCC-ARM, eg from https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

It also requires code to generate a CRC and insert it into the binary; one such
example can be found here:

https://github.com/microbuilder/LPC1343CodeBase/blob/master/tools/lpcrc/lpcrc.c


You'll need to include both the CRC tool and arm-none-eabi-* in your PATH.
